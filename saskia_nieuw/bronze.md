subtitle: "A series of Memories of Trees"
intro: "When I look at trees I see living creatures. They grow and breathe. But they give us O2 and food, shadow, protection and energy. They bring beauty and harmony in the landscape. They form a connection between heaven and earth. Their history and experiences are shown in their shape as we can see, but memories are kept inside: children climbing in their branches, a couple dancing around, a horse passing by. These memories I show in my bronze trees."
